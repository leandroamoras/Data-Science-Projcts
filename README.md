 # About me :
 
I am a Computer Science student at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Goi√°s](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontif%C3%ADcia_Universidade_Cat%C3%B3lica_de_Goi%C3%A1s). I come from a great trajectory in the market, going through the positions of Data Analyst I, IT Consultant II, Data Scientist I in large companies such as [Enrst & Young](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_%26_Young), currently I work as Data Engineer II at [Porto Seguro](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_(empresa)).

I have tremendous passion and understanding of data-driven processes. I seek to get involved in projects with a significant impact on business and society decisions.

In my spare time, I like to play video games, play guitar, produce electronic music or play football.

Well that's me! Welcome to my codespace.
