 # About me :
 
I'm a computer science student turned data scientist and love leveraging data-driven solutions that impact business and society. My first encounter with data science occurred when I worked as a Data Analyst at Ernst & Young Brazil, where I built classification and regression models to help optimize the file delivery logistics at Ernst & Young SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil headquarters.

After that, I earned the EY Data Science Bronze certification and then managed to be promoted to Technology Consultant with a focus on Data Analysis. After this experience, I finally had the opportunity to work as a Data Scientist at Base Flow, taking on data-driven and data visualization projects.

At the moment, I am a freelancer and I am looking for professional opportunities.
