This is the repository where I post my data science, machine learning, and deep learning projects.
# Projects:
 - In this project, I performed the treatment and exploratory analysis in the Forbes 2021 Billionarios base, in order to understand the standards of living among the members of the list.

# Project motivation:

For the initialization of my portfolio on github, I studied and chose the Forbes 2021 Billionarios database, in order to show my skills of cleaning and processing data and extracting insights. In this project, my main intention is to understand the patterns among the members of the list, such as: Nationality, Place of Birth, Degree of Study, Origin of Heritage and Information about the family. The final conclusion is amazing!
